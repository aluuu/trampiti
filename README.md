# trampiti

Clojure library designed to provide API to some of cryptocoin exchanges ([Cryptsy](https://www.cryptsy.com/) now and [BTC-e](https://btc-e.com/) in future).

## Usage

Basic usage in REPL:

    user=> (require '[trampiti.core :as t])
    user=> (let [crypsy (t/->Cryptsy "api-key" "api-secret")]
               (c/market-data crypsy :all))

Full list of API methods you can see at [Cryptsy API docs](https://www.cryptsy.com/pages/api).

## TODO

- implement BTC-e API
